This is a mod that makes VD not as recycled from previous games. Also serves as a tribute to whatever inspired me to make this garbage collection of mods.
Pretty much a cool spellcard gallery I made in my spare time.
While I like to compare the difficulty of KWBaWC to a (bad) CAVE game, this one is more on par with the first two photo games, "Shoot the Bullet" and "Double Spoiler," which isn't a huge downgrade to be honest.
Enjoy the show! Just don't have nightmares about it.

Finally, just a heads up, cameo characters that relate to Okina and dreams by "Bravi" and "PKWeegee" show up in the 3rd Friday and penultimate scene,
the whole day being the tribute to what inspired me to make this, but I'm currently working on an alternative version that is more grounded, so stay tooned!
